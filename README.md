# Software-Guild-Work
This contains all assignments that I turned in as work to the Software Guild. There are numerous subprojects, and as I get the time to, I will add explanations of each individual purpose.

# Hello Guild & Hello World
Both of these projects were used as introductions to committing on Git, using Bitbucket and Crucible, and tying commits to Jira issues.


# Warmups
Week 1.

These were a number of exercises given early in the course to help practice core programming concepts, such as dealing with loops and arrays. The entire Tests project and BLL documentation and framework were prewritten. 
The task was to get at least half of the tests to pass, with the goal of each method written in the corresponding txt file in the BLL Docs folder, and to do more as time permitted.
At some point, I may finish these for completion's sake.

# RockPaperScissors
Week 1.

This project was to create a relatively basic console application for a player to face the computer in Rock Paper Scissors.
This was one of the earliest projects.

# Factorizor2
Week 2.

This project was a relatively simple calculator to determine a given number's factors, and whether or not it was a prime number or a perfect number.
This project was used as an introduction to unit testing, as well as having separate projects and layers in applications.

# Battleship
Week 2.

This project was considered by many to be a very difficult project. The entire BLL and Test projects were prewritten, and the instructions were to finish writing the game without modifying existing code.
This was an exercise in working with others' code, and determining the purpose of unknown code by looking at tests, then being able to build on top of said code.
Additionally, this was further practice in writing unit tests.
