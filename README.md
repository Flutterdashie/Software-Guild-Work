# Software-Guild-Work
This contains all assignments that I turned in as work to the Software Guild. There are numerous subprojects, and as I get the time to, I will add explanations of each individual purpose.

# First Half: C# OOP
## Hello Guild & Hello World
Both of these projects were used as introductions to committing on Git, using Bitbucket and Crucible, and tying commits to Jira issues.

## Warmups
###### Week 1.
These were a number of exercises given early in the course to help practice core programming concepts, such as dealing with loops and arrays. The entire Tests project and BLL documentation and framework were prewritten. 
The task was to get at least half of the tests to pass, with the goal of each method written in the corresponding txt file in the BLL Docs folder, and to do more as time permitted.
At some point, I may finish these for completion's sake.

## RockPaperScissors
###### Week 1.
This project was to create a relatively basic console application for a player to face the computer in Rock Paper Scissors.
This was one of the earliest projects.

## Factorizor2
###### Week 2.
This project was a relatively simple calculator to determine a given number's factors, and whether or not it was a prime number or a perfect number.
This project was used as an introduction to unit testing, as well as having separate projects and layers in applications.

## Battleship
###### Week 2.
This project was considered by many to be a very difficult project. The entire BLL and Test projects were prewritten, and the instructions were to finish writing the game without modifying existing code.
This was an exercise in working with others' code, and determining the purpose of unknown code by looking at tests, then being able to build on top of said code.
Additionally, this was further practice in writing unit tests.

## LINQExercises
###### Week 3.
This project was my first proper introduction to LINQ. Similarly to Warmups, a list of specifications for each method was given, and the task was to use LINQ to complete the given task. Foreach loops were only to be used in printing data, and not in operations. Everything other than Program.cs was prewritten.

## SGBank
###### Week 4.
This project was what I would consider the first major undertaking. It represented an introduction to dependency injection, interfaces, and mocking. 
It represented a banking application, and the code for a basic account that could only be deposited into, as well as the start of the UI, was prewritten. I was tasked with creating 2 other account types from specifications, adding more features to the UI, making all accounts able to withdraw with specific guidelines, and write unit tests for all of it. The specs were broken down into very specific numbered tasks, making it quite easy to plan what needed to be done at what time, similar to being a junior developer continuing a senior developer's already-planned work.

## FlooringMastery
###### Weeks 5 & 6.
This represented the final project of the solely OOP-focused half of the course.
It is a console-based application made to handle orders for a fictional flooring company, using multiple implementations of an order repository with CRUD functionality, as well as a layered application structure.
Unfortunately, I feel as though I could have done much better in my layering, and making sure that my code is single-purposed. If I get the chance, I want to rewrite portions of it. That being said, it is fully functional and unit-tested.

# Second Half: C# DDWA
